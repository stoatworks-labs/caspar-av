# caspar-AV user guide

caspar-AV is **a live-events media server built on CasparCG**. You place screens on a show
canvas, build cues that change several of them on one frame, and fire them from a trigger grid —
all in a browser, with every command it sends visible along the bottom of the window.

> **Before you rely on this:** the protocol work was derived from the CasparCG 2.5.0 source and
> then **verified against a real CasparCG 2.5.0 server** (Ubuntu 24.04, headless, Mesa llvmpipe),
> which caught six genuine bugs — including a command-ordering mistake that broke every `MIXER`
> and `CG` command. But it has **never been run on real output hardware or in a live show**.
> Validate it on your own rig first.

## What you need

- **CasparCG Server 2.5** reachable over the network. caspar-AV speaks AMCP on TCP 5250 and
  listens for OSC telemetry over UDP.
- **media-scanner** on HTTP 8000, if you want the Media and Templates pages to have anything in
  them.
- A browser for the console. It does not have to be the machine running the daemon.

**No CasparCG to hand?** Run the fixture instead. It speaks real AMCP framing, real `REQ`/`RES`
correlation and pushes real OSC telemetry, and it stands in for media-scanner too — so every page
has something to show. It renders no pictures.

```bash
python3 scripts/fake-caspar.py
```

---

## Running it

```bash
cargo build --release
cd console && npm ci && npm run build && cd ..
./target/release/caspar-avd --host <your-caspar-host> --show myshow.json
```

Then open <http://localhost:8080>. There are also prebuilt binaries for macOS, Windows and Linux —
see the README's Download section.

On macOS, **take the `.dmg` or `.pkg`**: those are Developer ID-signed and notarised and open
normally. The `.tar.gz` payload is not signed — it carries only an ad-hoc signature, so Gatekeeper
refuses it outright. The Windows builds are unsigned and SmartScreen objects once.
[UNSIGNED.md](UNSIGNED.md) covers all of that plus the Defender Firewall prompt.

Against a real server, it is worth checking the protocol assumptions still hold on your build:

```bash
python3 scripts/protocol-probe.py --host <your-caspar-host>
```

### Why there's a daemon at all

CasparCG speaks AMCP over raw TCP and pushes state as OSC over UDP. A browser can do neither. So
`caspar-avd` holds the connection and serves the console over ordinary HTTP.

The console is a **passive mirror**: it holds no authoritative state, renders the daemon's
snapshot, and sends commands. Two operators on two laptops see the same thing, and a browser that
reconnects is immediately correct.

---

## The console

Six pages on one shared frame, chosen from the tab bar along the bottom, with the **command log**
always visible above it — because "did that command actually land?" is the question a show asks
most. Each line shows the AMCP that went out and the server's status code back.

---

## Screens — the show canvas

A **screen** is a named output: a CasparCG channel and layer, placed as a rectangle on the show
canvas. Drag it to move, use the corner handle to resize.

![The Screens page: four screens placed on a 3840x1080 canvas, an inspector on the right with the raw fill values, and the command log along the bottom.](assets/screens.png)

*Every screenshot in this guide is a real render of the console against
`scripts/fake-caspar.py`, captured by `scripts/screenshots.py` — so the UI is genuine and no
picture is coming out of anything.*

The right-hand inspector is where the mapping stops being abstract:

- **Channel** and **Layer** are the CasparCG channel/layer the screen owns — the `1–10` and `2–30`
  labels on the canvas.
- **x, y, w, h** are normalised fill values, and they write **`MIXER FILL`** live as you drag.
- The corner-pin numbers write **`MIXER PERSPECTIVE`**, which is a real four-corner warp — this is
  what makes projector keystone possible without anything outside CasparCG.
- **Enabled** off leaves the screen defined but unmapped. A greyed screen in the list (like
  "Lobby screen" above) is one of these.

**Re-send mapping** pushes the whole mapping again — the thing to reach for after a server
restart, when CasparCG has forgotten its mixer state and the console has not.

## Media and Channels

**Media** is the library from media-scanner, with thumbnails. Double-click a clip to play it onto
the target screen.

![The Media page: the media-scanner library with thumbnails.](assets/media.png)

**Channels** is live state straight from OSC — what is playing on each channel, position and
duration — plus a raw AMCP command line for when something is wrong and you need to talk to the
server directly.

![The Channels page: per-channel playback state from OSC telemetry, with a raw AMCP command line.](assets/channels.png)

---

## Cues

A **cue** is a list of actions across several screens, fired as a single `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` batch —
so every screen it touches changes **on the same frame**, rather than drifting apart by however
long the commands took to send.

![The Cues page: a cue list on the left, the selected cue's three actions in the centre, and the action builder on the right.](assets/cues.png)

Build a cue by picking an action type (play a clip, set opacity, run a template…), the screen it
applies to, and its parameters, then **Add to cue**. **Fire** sends the batch.

> **Auto-follow is stored, not executed.** A cue carries an auto-follow time, and the field is
> there in the inspector, but **nothing fires the next cue when it elapses**. Treat the number as
> a note to yourself until that lands.

---

## Templates

CasparCG HTML templates, listed from media-scanner. Where a template publishes a **GDD** schema,
the data form is **generated from that schema** rather than typed as raw JSON — so a lower-third
with name and title fields shows two labelled boxes.

![The Templates page: a template's GDD schema rendered as a data form.](assets/templates.png)

Templates without a GDD schema still work; you supply the data as JSON.

---

## Grid

The cues as trigger pads, for when the show is running and you want a target you can hit without
reading. **Number keys 1–9 and 0 fire the first ten.**

![The Grid page: cues laid out as trigger pads.](assets/grid.png)

## What isn't built

Worth knowing before you plan a show around it:

- **No timeline or timecode playback.**
- **No auto-follow execution** — cues carry a follow time, nothing fires it.
- **No soft-edge blending UI.** `MIXER CLIP` and the blend modes exist in CasparCG; caspar-AV
  doesn't expose them yet.
- **No MIDI or OSC control in.** You drive it from the console.
- **No multi-server rigs** — one CasparCG server per daemon.
- **No audio metering.**

[scope.md](scope.md) is the honest, maintained version of this list.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| **Console loads, header says not connected** | The daemon can't reach CasparCG on AMCP 5250. The console talks to the daemon, not the server — a healthy console proves nothing about the server. |
| **Screens page is fine, nothing on Media or Templates** | media-scanner isn't reachable on HTTP 8000. It is a separate service from the playout server. |
| **Channels page never updates** | OSC telemetry isn't arriving — it is UDP, and a firewall dropping it looks exactly like an idle server. |
| **Dragged a screen, picture didn't move** | Check the log for the `MIXER FILL` line and its status code. If the command went out and returned OK, the mapping is right and the layer is probably empty. |
| **Mapping lost after a server restart** | CasparCG forgets mixer state; the console doesn't. Press **Re-send mapping**. |
| **A cue's screens change at slightly different times** | That should not happen — the batch commits on one frame. Check the log for a `COMMIT` that didn't return OK. |
| **Next cue never fires on its follow time** | Auto-follow is stored but not executed. |
| **Windows: console won't load and cues never arrive** | The Defender Firewall prompt was denied. See [UNSIGNED.md](UNSIGNED.md). |
