# caspar-AV

> **AI-assisted project.** This codebase was created with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
> (Anthropic), directed and reviewed by a human author. The protocol work was
> derived from the CasparCG 2.5.0 source and then **verified against a real
> CasparCG 2.5.0 server** (Ubuntu 24.04, headless, Mesa llvmpipe) — which caught
> six genuine bugs, including a command-ordering mistake that broke every
> `MIXER` and `CG` command. It has **not** been run on real output hardware or
> in a live show. Validate on your own rig before relying on it.

A **live-events media server built on CasparCG** — screens on a canvas, cues that
change several of them on one frame, a media library, graphics templates and a
trigger grid, in a browser.

Not affiliated with or endorsed by the CasparCG project.

![Output mapping on the Screens page](docs/assets/screens.png)

> Four outputs placed on a 3840×1080 show canvas. Dragging a screen writes
> `MIXER FILL`; the corner-pin numbers write `MIXER PERSPECTIVE`. Every command
> sent is in the log along the bottom.

**Click around the console: <https://caspar-av-demo.stoatworks-labs.com>** — the real
console in your browser, and **firing a cue works**: the command log fills with
the AMCP the bridge actually compiled for it. It replays a recording of
`caspar-avd` running against `scripts/fake-caspar.py`, so nothing is driving a
real server and nothing is saved. See [demo/README.md](demo/README.md).

*A 46-second tour of the real console, driven through its own controls. It is talking to
`scripts/fake-caspar.py` — a real protocol fixture (AMCP response framing, `REQ`/`RES`
correlation, `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` batching, OSC telemetry) that renders nothing, so no picture
is coming out of anything.*

## Why this exists

[CasparCG Server](https://github.com/CasparCG/server) is a superb playout engine
with an odd gap around it: the organisation's own `Frontend` is archived, and the
maintained client is a Qt desktop app. There is no maintained web front end.

More to the point, CasparCG is presented as a *broadcast playout* engine, while
the pieces needed to drive it as a *live-events media server* are already in it
and simply unexposed:

| What a media server needs | What CasparCG already has |
|---|---|
| Screens placed on a show canvas | `MIXER FILL` — position and scale, in normalised units |
| Projector keystone / corner-pin | `MIXER PERSPECTIVE` — a real four-corner warp |
| Cues that change several outputs at once | `BEGIN` / `COMMIT` — locks every touched channel, releases on one frame |
| Soft-edge blending, masking | `MIXER CLIP`, `MIXER CROP`, blend modes |
| A media library with thumbnails | `media-scanner`, over HTTP |
| Data-driven graphics | HTML templates with **GDD** schemas |

caspar-AV adds the layer above: a **show** — canvas, screens, cues, pads — that
compiles down to those commands.

## Why a daemon and not just a web page

CasparCG speaks **AMCP over raw TCP** (port 5250) and pushes state as **OSC over
UDP**. A browser can do neither. So caspar-AV is a small Rust daemon that holds
the connection and serves a React console over ordinary HTTP:

```
Browser console (React/Vite)
        │  REST + WebSocket (snapshot mirror)
caspar-avd (Rust)                     ← show model, cue compiler, command log
        │  AMCP/TCP 5250      │  OSC/UDP        │  HTTP 8000
CasparCG Server 2.5           telemetry          media-scanner
```

The console is a **passive mirror**: it holds no authoritative state, renders the
daemon's snapshot and sends commands. Two operators on two laptops see the same
thing, and a browser that reconnects is immediately correct.

## Status

Built, tested, and **verified against a real CasparCG 2.5.0 server**.

- **`amcp`** — protocol codec and async client. Command building with the
  server's real escaping rules, response framing by status code, `REQ`/`RES`
  correlation, `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` batching. 38 tests.
- **`casparosc`** — OSC decoder and the telemetry state tree, raw plus a typed
  digest. 13 tests.
- **`scanner`** — media-scanner client: media with ffprobe metadata, thumbnails,
  templates with GDD schemas, fonts. 5 tests.
- **`showd`** (`caspar-avd`) — the bridge: supervised connection with reconnect,
  telemetry subscription, show model and cue compiler, REST + WebSocket API,
  serves the console. 12 tests.
- **console** — six pages on one shared frame, ported from
  [OpenStage](https://github.com/stoatworks-labs/openstage)'s console.

**Verified against real CasparCG 2.5.0** — `scripts/protocol-probe.py` checks 22
protocol claims with raw sockets (sharing no code with the crates, so it can
disprove them), and `scripts/verify-mapping.py` has the server `PRINT` real
frames to confirm `MIXER FILL` and `MIXER PERSPECTIVE` actually move pixels.
See [docs/scope.md](docs/scope.md) for what that does and does not cover.

**Not built:** timeline/timecode playback, auto-follow execution (cues carry a
follow time; nothing fires it yet), soft-edge blending UI, MIDI/OSC control in,
multi-server rigs, audio metering.

## Getting started

```bash
cargo build --release
cd console && npm ci && npm run build && cd ..
./target/release/caspar-avd --host <your-caspar-host> --show myshow.json
```

Then open <http://localhost:8080>.

No CasparCG to hand? Run the fake one. It speaks real AMCP framing, real
`REQ`/`RES` correlation and pushes real OSC telemetry — and stands in for
media-scanner too, so the Media and Templates pages have something to show:

```bash
python3 scripts/fake-caspar.py
```

Against a real server, check the protocol assumptions still hold:

```bash
python3 scripts/protocol-probe.py --host <your-caspar-host>
```

## The pages

Six pages on one shared frame, with the command log always along the bottom —
because "did that command actually land?" is the question a show asks most.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Media** — the library from media-scanner, with thumbnails. Double-click to
play onto the target screen.

<img src="docs/assets/media.png" alt="Media page">
</td>
<td width="50%">

**Channels** — live state straight from OSC: what is playing, position and
duration, plus a raw AMCP command line for when something is wrong.

<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Cues** — several screens changed together. Fired as one `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`
batch, so every screen changes on the same frame.

**Templates** — where a template publishes a **GDD** schema, the data form is
generated from it rather than typed as JSON.

**Grid** — cues as trigger pads. Number keys 1–9 and 0 fire the first ten.

**Screens** — output mapping, shown at the top of this page.

Every screenshot here is a real render against
`scripts/fake-caspar.py`, captured by `scripts/screenshots.py`.

## Inspired by

caspar-AV is not a clone of any of these, and is not affiliated with them. They
are listed because the ideas are theirs, and pretending otherwise would be
dishonest.

- **Pixera, disguise, Millumin and Resolume** — the show model. Screens placed
  on a canvas, corner-pin per output, and a cue that changes several screens on
  one frame are all conventions these established. What caspar-AV does is show
  that CasparCG already has the primitives to work that way.
- **DaVinci Resolve** — the shape of the console: a bottom page-tab bar, and
  every page built from the same toolbar / left / centre / right / bottom frame
  with a context inspector on the right.
- **[OpenStage](https://github.com/stoatworks-labs/openstage)** — the console
  shell itself, the snapshot-mirror architecture, and the WebSocket-with-polling
  connection layer, all ported directly from its own console.
- **[CasparCG](https://github.com/CasparCG/server)** — the engine that does all
  the actual work here.

## Windows SmartScreen & Defender Firewall

macOS builds are **Developer ID-signed and notarised by Apple** — they open
normally, with no Gatekeeper warning and no quarantine step. The Windows
binaries are **not** code-signed, so Windows still warns you the first time.

- **Windows** — SmartScreen shows *"Windows protected your PC"* →
  **More info** → **Run anyway**.
- **Windows Defender Firewall** — first launch pops *"Allow caspar-AV to communicate on
  these networks"*. Tick **Private** (and **Domain** on a managed network) — caspar-AV
  needs it to serve the web console and reach your CasparCG server over AMCP and OSC.
  Deny it and the console won't load and cues will never reach CasparCG.
- **Linux** — no signing gate.

Per-artifact steps, self-signing, checksum verification and the Defender Firewall reset
procedure: **[docs/UNSIGNED.md](docs/UNSIGNED.md)**.

## Control it from Companion

[**companion-module-caspar-av**](https://github.com/stoatworks-labs/companion-module-caspar-av) is a [Bitfocus Companion](https://bitfocus.io/companion) connection module for this app.

Fires cues and pads, runs screen transport and mixer, invokes templates and
sends raw AMCP — with per-screen presets generated from the show.

It keeps three health signals separate rather than merging them: the module's
link to caspar-avd, caspar-avd's link to CasparCG, and **whether OSC telemetry
is arriving at all**. The third matters because commands can work perfectly
while nothing knows what is on screen.

It is not in the official Companion module store — install it via
**Settings → Developer modules path**.
